This is V1 of Team 5: Fat Cat's code template. All work has been done by John Adamick for CPE-490 Fall 2021 and Spring 2022.

Folders:
./include
	Supposedly used for specifically containing header files. As of V1, we will not be using this and all class files (.h and .cpp) should be placed into ./lib.
./lib
	Includes all files that will be added to your main.cpp using "#include" such as custom classes, libraries, etc.
./src
	Includes the main.cpp file that will be the entryway to the main block of your code.
./test
	Includes the README for PlatformIO, the software to allow testing Arduinos and Teensys in Atom.io
